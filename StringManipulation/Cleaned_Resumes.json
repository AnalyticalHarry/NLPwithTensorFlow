digital networks cisco is widearea application services ipv users can move to ipv and receive services such as endtoend security quality of service qos and globally unique addresses the ipv address space reduces the need for private addresses and network address translation nat processing by border routers at network edges implementing basic ipv connectivity in the cisco ios software consists of assigning ipv addresses to individual router interfaces the forwarding of ipv traffic can be enabled globally and cisco express forwarding switching for ipv can also be enabled the primary motivation for ipv is the need to meet the demand for globally unique ip addresses mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v addressing product ipv support on waas wide area

share files globally at lan speeds over the wan with wan optimization inside of a router accelerating tcpbased applications on a given network waas system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines waes that work together to optimize tcp traffic over your network when client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the waes so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server the waes examine the traffic and use builtin application policies to determine whether to

project company worked for huawei technologies duration from date jun to date may designation software engineer client huawei china project dopra description of the project dopra is the platform for telecom products it is a proprietary platform and has company internal customers it has main two planes system management and system service planes and several sub modules i have successfully worked on the following modules module mml ini parser tool mml is configuration tool used in communication equipments this configuration tool has set of default and user defined commands ini parsing tool is a tool which accepts mml commands in certain grammar and generates resource file and binary file respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands involved in the development testing verification of the module on windows module man machine language mml is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments it uses clientserver architecture mml server communicates with both the client and the app in the equipment it receives mml commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to app to process it after acquiring the processing result the server generates a mml report and sends it back to the client it interacts with other system modules connection management authorization management command process data synchronization event notification command parsing logalarm handling are some of the functions of mml server involved in the development defect fixing and verification of the module on windows linux and vxworks platforms involved in several release activities module configuration management configuration management module is core module of system management its main function is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration tool layer and the application layer and provide related configuration command communication mechanism any information that can be modified by the userapplication and that affects the functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data all configuration commands can be sent to configuration management module using a common interface type configuration data management module is a supplementary optional component that can be loaded to provide a persistent storage amp retrieval mechanism for applications static configuration data involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows linux and vxworks platforms involved in several release activities module tl transaction language tl is a widely used legacy management protocol in telecommunications it is a crossvendor crosstechnology manmachine language and is widely used to manage synchronous optical networks sonet it is defined for operation system network element machinetomachine interfaces tl corresponds to the user system language usl which is the language for humanto machine interactions it is used for managing network elements in a network tl module is an interface between an application and client client sends the tl commands to perform some configuration operations in the applications tl module process the client text tl commands according to standard specification tl gr and interacts with the configuration management module and convert response messages back to tl response messages involved in development verification and customer and release activities i was a module lead for this project module qx the qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the gui of nms by this protocol ne can communicate with scc system communication and control software in different operation system each command has defined format commands are given in binary form qx module acts as an interface between the client and application involved in development verification and customer and release activities i was a module lead for this project role designerdeveloper reviewer responsibility

project wireless lan describes mac and phy wireless stations are connected to form a basic service area which is controlled by a base station called access point access point is a special device which basically acts as a bridge between wired and wireless media connected to a distributed system generally ethernet several access points can be connected to a distribution media to form an extended service set in split ap architecture ap is connect to a central controller called access controller in short ac ap has the minimal functionalities such as receiving the data from the radio and forwarding data and management frames to ac power management advertising beacons handling control frames management operations such as association authentication handling frames conversion between will be done by ac i was involved in the development of feature development defect analysis testing activities in the cli frame handling association and beacon advertisement modules module wlan support for wmm e qos requirements wmm is a protocol designed by the wifi forum to provide quality of service to wireless traffic this project basically deals with providing wlan support for wmm module this includes handling qos frames in the uplink down link data flow priority mapping for qos frames fragmentation and reassembly of the qos frames security related modifications for qos frames power management of qos stations etc i was involved in the design review coding of the uplink down link data flow fragmentation and reassembly of the qos frames role developer responsibility to design
